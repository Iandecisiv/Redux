### Tech

This project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Axios]( https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
* [ReactStrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) - Reactstrap provides prebuilt Bootstrap 4 components that allow a great deal of flexibility and prebuilt validation
* [Redux-Logger](https://github.com/LogRocket/redux-logger) -  Redux logging tool that lets you replay problems as if they happened in your own browser. 
* [Styled-Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) - Visual primitives for the component age. Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress
